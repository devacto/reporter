# reporter

This app summarises survey results (in csv format) and produces a nice console output. Detailed instructions [here](../INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Then run `./gradlew installDist` to create the binary.

To see a sample result, run:
```
./build/install/reporter/bin/reporter ./example-data/survey-1.csv ./example-data/survey-1-responses.csv
```

Your output should look something like:

```
